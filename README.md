# chet-rum

*chet-rum* is a simple chatroom demo built with Node.js and WebSocket.

Run `npm run serve` to start the server. Access `localhost:3000` to get into the chatroom. If you want to modify the port, modify `./server/server.js` along with `./view/js/script.js`.

I also wrote an article to conclude the using of *socket.io* library. Click [here](https://www.cnblogs.com/zxuuu/p/12800549.html) to view.
